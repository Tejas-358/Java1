# Assignmnet 1 : 
Part 1.1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to
implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner,
BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

Classes : Main class - Factorial and Fibonacci Methods

Part 1.2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement
add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate
Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean
calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in
the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input &
displays the avg. of numbers)

Classes : Main class and Calculator class - methods(add, power, sub, div, mulit, mean, standardDeviation)

# Assignmnet 2 :
Part 2.1: W.a.p that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept
numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on
whether they are even or odd.

Classes : Main class - Even and Odd

Part 2.2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an
array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return the
index of the 1st number.

Classes - Main class - findNearestNeighbors method

Part 2.3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice
versa.

Classes - Main class, ATA class - ATAL and ALTA methods

# Assignmnet 3 : 
Create a Student class describing attributes of a student like prn, name, DoB, marks etc. Create an array of objects of Student class and perform operations like: Add students, Display, Search (by prn, by name, by position), Update/Edit and Delete. 

Classes : Main class - Main, Student, StudentManager

# Assignmnet 4 : 
There are 52 cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of 13 ranks. Represent a deck of cards as an array of
Objects (*you may use the Vector class)
1.  Use integers to encode the ranks and suits.
2.  Have suitable default & parameterized constructors.
3.  all data members to have private access.
4.  The class ‘Card’ to have the following methods:
createDeck(), printCard(), printDeck (),sameCard(),compareCard(), sortCard(), findCard() which searches through an array or vector of Cards to see whether it contains a certain card, dealCards() function: to print 5 random cards from the existing deck.

Classes : CardGame, Card

# Assignmnet 5 :
Part 5.1: Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface s so that we can implement concrete classes like circle, triangle, rectangle class from it.

Classes : Main, Shape, Triangle, Rectangle, Circle

Part 5.2: In this exercise, take an abstract class which is defined below and develop two classes. The abstract class represents the basic building block for employees in a personnel database.

Classes - Main, Employee, NormalEmployee, BonusEmployee

# Assignmnet 6 :
Part 6.1: An implementation of IntStack (integer stack) that uses fixed
storage as well as "growable" using interface.

Create a user defined package “pkg_Stack” where the interface is stored.
The other two complete classes will need to import the package
‘pkg_Stack’ and then use it.

Classes : Main, Fixed_stk, Growable_stk, Interface_STK

Part 6.2: Program to implement the following Multiple Inheritance.

Classes - Main, Result, Student, Exam
