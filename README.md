# Assignmnet 1 : 
Part 1.1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to
implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner,
BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

Classes : Main class - Factorial and Fibonacci Methods

Part 1.2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement
add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate
Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean
calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in
the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input &
displays the avg. of numbers)

Classes : Main class and Calculator class - methods(add, power, sub, div, mulit, mean, standardDeviation)

# Assignmnet 2 :
Part 2.1: W.a.p that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept
numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on
whether they are even or odd.

Classes : Main class - Even and Odd

Part 2.2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an
array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return the
index of the 1st number.

Classes - Main class - findNearestNeighbors method

Part 2.3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice
versa.

Classes - Main class, ATA class - ATAL and ALTA methods
